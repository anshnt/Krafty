# Krafty
## Experience the lifestyle<br><br>

<h3><b><u>Introduction</h3></b></u>
We all love doing shopping. This pandemic has made it difficult to go to a mall and shop. But no matter what, the style must go on and we respect that. So here we are, the best fashion centric e-commerce website with variety of choices. You choose from the best of the products and we deliver it to you, fast and safe right at your doorstep. <br><br>

<h3><b><u>Problem Statement</h3></b></u>
<li>The covid-19 pandemic has impacted the fashion industry. Their sales have dropped as malls are closed and people don't trust the authenticity of the other online sales.
<li> Most of the e-commerce applications either try to show you a lot of advertisements after you see their products or track your data and use it to manipulate you.
<li> It is diificult for a user to store some products in the wishlist(cart) and buy them later on. 
<li> User interface of the e-commerce apps are complex and a new naive user finds him lost in the website with a lot of buttons to click.<br><br>


<h3><b><u>Solution</h3></b></u>
<li> So we come up with our own e-commerce app "Krafty". A simple, elegant website on which you can shop quickly and easily and browse through hundreds of products.
<li> We know that security of your account matters and so we came up with a user-friendly authentication system. Simple to sign up for new users or login for existing user.
<li> Products have simple two options, either add them to cart or buy them right away. An user friendly product display from which a user can select the product.
<li> An updatable cart system, where you can update the quantities of product, remove products or add new products and see changes in the total billing amount in real time.
<li> An easy to checkout option. Before checking out have a complete idea about the breakage of the billing amount, rate and amount of every product, with the shipping charges and tax information.<br><br>


<h3><b><u> Key Features </h3></b></u>
<li><b> Authentication</b><br>
Krafty has an amazing authentication system where a existing user can login to the same state where he left. Login requires just your email address and the password. New user can sign up with your email, other user information and create a new password through which user can login.

<li><b> Product Display</b><br>
Krafty has a user friendly product display system. Every product has perfect sized image of the products along with price of the product. User has an option to add that product into the cart or checkout by buying that single product. News products can be added, product details can be modified or products can be removed very easily.

<li><b> Interactive Cart </b><br>
Krafty has a interactive cart. User can change the quantity of the products in cart, remove the products, add new products and see the changes in the amount in real time. Cart saves the state of the user, so refreshing the page, closure of session does not impact the items within cart. User can logout and after logging again he can resume from same state. <br><br>
